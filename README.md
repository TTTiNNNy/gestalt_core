To build as a library, just write `cargo build`.
To build the example that locate in the examples folder, enter `cargo build --examples`. 
Before building, you need to specify the memory parameters in the memory.x file and the desired target in `.cargo/config`.
The example only uses systic. To check the functionality, will be enough to set a breakpoint for each function.
